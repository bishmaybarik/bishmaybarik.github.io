# About Me

Hello! I am currently pursuing a master's degree in economics at [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/home/), focusing on research. My primary interest lies in macroeconomics and economic growth, and I aspire to further my academic journey by pursuing a PhD. I frequently work with data and coding using tools like [Stata](https://www.stata.com) and [MATLAB](https://in.mathworks.com/company.html). My academic goal is to contribute to research through impactful publications.

When not engaged in academic pursuits, I enjoy photography, exploring my surroundings, and contemplating the next big economic breakthrough.
